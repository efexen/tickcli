Tickcli
======

Tickcli is a command line interface for TickSpot time tracking service.

Tickcli will be attempting to provide access to the basic Tick features
using command line including:

- Viewing a log of previous time entries
- Viewing the current day/week/month for easy viewing of how much time
  has been logged so far
- Mapping clients/projects/tasks to easy to remember keys
- Adding new time entries

**Tickcli is currently very much work in progress**, it is being written as
a simple tool for myself and my colleagues for logging time from
command line as well as for learning the Go programming language.

## Todo
- Add configuration file and/or command line flags to set the company,
  email and password locally (currently you are required to edit the
  source file for this
- Implement the features listed above
- Better error handling
- Tests!
- Learn more about Go and refactor work so far
